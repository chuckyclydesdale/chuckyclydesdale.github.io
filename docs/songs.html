one of the first to be chosen for this operation was Anadelle
on october eighteenth nineteen fifty
they implanted an electrode in her brain
and gave her one stimulation

DELLA SLEEPS DELLA TALKS
IN HER DREAMS AT NIGHT
TWISTED FACES AND TRACES
PAINT THE BACK OF HER EYES
WHEN SHE LOOKS AT THEM NOW
YOU KNOW SHE'S JUST NOT THE SAME
AS SHE WAS BEFORE

HERE'S A SPOT IT'S A LOT
FOR A HUMAN BRAIN
LACE EM UP LET EM DOWN
CALL ME ANOTHER NAME
WHEN SHE LOOKS AT ME NOW
I SWEAR IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME
AS IT WAS BEFORE

what if you lost your capacity to feel pleasure
lost your sense of identity as a person
suppose reality as you had always known it
began to change before your eyes
life would become a nightmare
filled with terrifying fantasies
and for a schizophrenic
this is indeed what life becomes

HUNGRY CHILD DOES IT WILD
FOR A PHOTO PAGE
STITCH A CAPE NO ESCAPE
TILL SHE JUMPS FROM THE EDGE
WHEN SHE LOOKS AT ME NOW
IT NEVER DOES CHANGE
WHEN IT'S DOWN IN YOUR CORE

two years later, Anadelle wept
she knew her symptoms were coming back
and gradually she did return to her original condition
