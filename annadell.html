one of the first to be chosen for this operation was ANNADELL<br>
on october eighteenth nineteen fifty<br>
they implanted an electrode in her brain<br>
and gave her one stimulation<br>
<br>
DELLA SLEEPS DELLA TALKS<br>
IN HER DREAMS AT NIGHT<br>
TWISTED FACES AND TRACES<br>
PAINT THE BACK OF HER EYES<br>
WHEN SHE LOOKS AT THEM NOW<br>
YOU KNOW SHE'S JUST NOT THE SAME<br>
AS SHE WAS BEFORE<br>
<br>
HERE'S A SPOT IT'S A LOT<br>
FOR A HUMAN BRAIN<br>
LACE EM UP LET EM DOWN<br>
CALL ME ANOTHER NAME<br>
WHEN SHE LOOKS AT ME NOW<br>
I SWEAR IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME<br>
AS IT WAS BEFORE<br>
<br>
what if you lost your capacity to feel pleasure<br>
lost your sense of identity as a person<br>
suppose reality as you had always known it<br>
began to change before your eyes<br>
life would become a nightmare<br>
filled with terrifying fantasies<br>
and for a schizophrenic<br>
this is indeed what life becomes<br>
<br>
HUNGRY CHILD DOES IT WILD<br>
FOR A PHOTO PAGE<br>
STITCH A CAPE NO ESCAPE<br>
TILL SHE JUMPS FROM THE EDGE<br>
WHEN SHE LOOKS AT ME NOW<br>
IT NEVER DOES CHANGE<br>
WHEN IT'S DOWN IN YOUR CORE<br>
<br>
two years later, ANNADELL wept<br>
she knew her symptoms were coming back<br>
and gradually she did return to her original condition<br>
